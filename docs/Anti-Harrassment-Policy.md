# Anti-Harassment Policy

The Traversal team is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or national origin.

We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. For example, sexual language and imagery are not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled wihtout warning from the conference at the discretion of the conference organizers.

## Harassment

Harassment includes, but is not limited to:

* Verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age, religion, or national origin
* Sexual or sexualized images in public spaces
* Deliberate intimidation, stalking, or following
* Unwanted photography or recording
* Sustained disruption of talks or other events
* Inappropriate physical contact
* Unwelcome sexual attention
* Advocating for or encouraging any of the above behavior

## Enforcement

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, event organizers retain the right to take any actions to keep the event a welcoming environment for all participants. This includes warning the offender or expulsion from the conference. Event organizers may take action to redress anything designed to, or with the clear impact of, disrupting the event or making the environment hostile for any participants.

*We expect participants to follow these rules at all event venues and event-related social activities.*

## Reporting

If someone makes you or anyone else feel unsafe or unwelcome, please report it as soon as possible. You can report concerns via any of the following means:

* Anonymously: _pending_
* In Person: Speak with any badged/shirt-indicating staff member such as at the registration table
* Phone: (303)731-3117

When taking a personal report, our staff will ensure you are safe and cannot be overheard. They may involve other event staff to ensure your report is managed properly. Once safe, we'll ask you to tell us about what happened. This can be upsetting, but we'll handle it as respectfully as possible, and you can bring someone to support you. You won't be asked to confront anyone and *we won't tell anyone who you are*.

Our team will be happy to help you contact hotel/venue security, local law enforcement, local support services, provide escorts, or otherwise assist you to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance.

## Exhibitors & Sponsors

Exhibitors in or around the event are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, exhibitors should not use sexualized images, activities, or other material. Booth staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualized clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualized environment.
