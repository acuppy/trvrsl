# Attendees

Traversal brings together a diverse, inclusive audience of two hundred professional
technologists. We spend two days together in
presenter-driven single-topic sessions and opportunities to discuss and interact.

Attendees are software developers across the spectrum from
UI/UX/Frontend through Backend, Data, and Ops. They primarily work in
web-centric technologies like JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, HTML, CSS, PHP,
CakePHP, Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, Java, Struts, Go, Elixir, Clojure, and
Elm. Attendees come to Traversal looking to spark the next big idea in their
work and career.
