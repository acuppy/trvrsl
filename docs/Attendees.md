# Attendees

Traversal brings together a diverse, inclusive audience of professional
technologists. Part conference and part workshop, we spend two days together in
a mix of presenter-driven single-topic sessions and collaborative
discussions/activities.

Attendees are professional software developers across the spectrum from
UI/UX/Frontend through Backend, Data, and Ops. They primarily work in
web-centric technologies like JavaScript, React, Angular, Vue, HTML, CSS, PHP,
CakePHP, Ruby, Rails, Python, Django, Java, Struts, Go, Elixir, Clojure, and
Elm. Attendees come to Traversal looking to spark the next big idea in their
work and career.
